    Simple "diff" applier (adapt this based on your environment)

    - For create_file, the diff can be the full desired file contents,
      optionally with leading '+' on each line.
    - For update_file, we treat the diff as the new file contents:
      keep lines starting with ' ' or '+', drop '-' lines and diff headers.

    This avoids context/delete mismatch errors while still letting the model
    send familiar diff-like patches.
